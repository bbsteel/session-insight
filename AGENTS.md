# Agent Instructions

- After every code or configuration change, provide a verifiable local address or command so the user can validate the result directly.
- If the application depends on a backend API, the verifiable address must be the full working app with backend connected. Do not provide a frontend-only dev-server URL unless the backend/API path is also verified.

## Terminal Interaction Positioning

- Keep terminal hit-testing and hover rendering anchored to xterm APIs. Clickable terminal affordances should use the established matcher + buffer scan + xterm MouseService + marker/decoration pattern.
- Do not introduce independent DOM overlay coordinate math for terminal rows. Hand-rolled `getBoundingClientRect()`/`cellHeight` calculations can drift from xterm by 1-2 rows because xterm accounts for screen padding, renderService CSS cell dimensions, ceil/clamp behavior, and viewport state internally.
- Use xterm marker/decoration rendering for hover feedback so visual positioning shares xterm's own viewport math.

## Product Scope

- Do not optimize new UI work for mobile. Design and verify the application as a desktop/local developer tool unless the user explicitly requests mobile support.
